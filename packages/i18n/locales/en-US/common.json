The Jan IngenHousz Institute was founded specifically to meet these major challenges.",
    "aboutDescription": "The world's population is growing, while the area of suitable agricultural land is shrinking and harvests are declining due to climate change. A breakthrough is urgently needed. To this end, JII-researchers are working to understand and improve the green engine of agriculture: photosynthesis."
