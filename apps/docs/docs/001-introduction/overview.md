# Overview

Our mission is to advance open science by sharing, integrating, and interpreting complex, large-scale datasets to uncover genetic linkages that influence photosynthesis.

Through this collaborative platform, we empower researchers to:

- Identify photosynthetic limitations and their genetic controls across diverse crops and environmental conditions
- Drive innovations to enhance photosynthetic efficiency and agricultural productivity

## Goals

- Collect time series data
- Store and manage photosynthesis data
- Provide tools to analyze photosynthesis
- Link real-world sensor data to genomics, novel analytics, and modeling
