# Overview

Our mission is to advance open science by sharing, integrating, and interpreting large-scale datasets to uncover genetic linkages that influence photosynthesis.

We provide an open platform that connects field sensor measurements, experiment metadata and genomics to help researchers identify photosynthetic limitations and their genetic controls across crops and environments.

## What we offer

- **Scalable data management:** ingest and store high-volume time-series from sensors and field trials.
- **Flexible experiment workflows:** create experiments, design measurement flows, and assign devices and locations.
- **Secure access & collaboration:** register via Email, ORCID or GitHub; invite collaborators and set visibility or embargoes.
- **Analysis & reproducibility:** run analysis macros, export data, and integrate with notebooks for reproducible research.

## Who is this for?

- Field researchers and plant scientists collecting sensor data
- Data scientists and bioinformaticians analysing time-series and genomic links
- Developers building integrations and analysis tools on top of openJII
