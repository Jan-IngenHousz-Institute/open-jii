# Key Features

This page highlights the main capabilities of the openJII platform. For detailed guides and examples, follow the links to the Web Platform and Mobile App documentation.

### Web platform

- **Scalable data layer:** ingest, store and query large time-series and sensor datasets efficiently.
- **Secure authentication & access:** sign in with magic-link email, ORCID or GitHub; control experiment visibility.
- **Experiment management:** create, edit and version experiments; add members, locations, metadata and tags. See the Web Platform [overview](../003-data-platform/002-web-platform/001-overview.md) and [create/edit experiment guide](../003-data-platform/002-web-platform/0013-create-add-experiment.md).
- **Measurement flow editor:** visual drag-and-drop editor (Instruction, Question, Measurement, Analysis) to define what field users should do.
- **Data exploration & analysis:** interactive dashboards, filters and export options for downstream analysis.
- **APIs & integrations:** ingestion via REST/MQTT and connectors for notebooks and external systems.

### Mobile app (Android)

- **Sensor support:** connect to supported sensors (MultispeQ) over Bluetooth and run measurements.
- **Fast workflow:** guided measurement flows for rapid field data collection, including questions and instructions.
- **Offline-first:** capture data offline and sync when network is available.
- **Seamless sync:** measurements sync to the web platform for analysis and sharing. 

See the Mobile App [overview](../003-data-platform/002-mobile-app.md) for device-specific details.
