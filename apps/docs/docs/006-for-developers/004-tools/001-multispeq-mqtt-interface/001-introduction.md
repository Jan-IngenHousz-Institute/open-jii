# Introduction

The MultispeQ MQTT Interface (MMI) is a command-line tool that facilitates communication between MultispeQ devices and MQTT brokers. It serves as a bridge that enables seamless data flow from devices to cloud infrastructure, making it an essential component in the OpenJII ecosystem for development purposes.
