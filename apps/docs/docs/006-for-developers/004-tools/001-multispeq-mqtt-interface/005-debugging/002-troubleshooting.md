# Troubleshooting

This document provides troubleshooting steps for diagnosing and resolving issues with the MultispeQ MQTT Interface tool.

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Checking Network Connectivity

Ensure your network connection is stable and you can reach the AWS IoT Core endpoint.

```bash
# Ping the AWS IoT Core endpoint
ping <your-aws-iot-endpoint>

# Test TLS connectivity
openssl s_client -connect <your-aws-iot-endpoint>:8883
```

### Verifying Certificate Validity

Check that your certificates are valid and correctly configured.

```bash
# Verify the client certificate
openssl x509 -in <cert_id>-certificate.pem.crt -text -noout

# Verify the private key
openssl rsa -in <cert_id>-private.pem.key -check

# Verify the CA certificate
openssl x509 -in root-CA.pem -text -noout
```

### Enabling Debug Logging

Set the `AWS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` to get detailed logs.

```bash
export AWS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Reviewing Logs

Check the logs for detailed error messages and stack traces. This can provide insights into what might be going wrong.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Issues

**Issue**: Unable to connect to AWS IoT Core

**Solution**:

- Verify the `AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT` environment variable is set correctly
- Check your network connection and firewall settings
- Ensure your certificates are valid and correctly configured

### Authentication Errors

**Issue**: Invalid certificate or access denied

**Solution**:

- Verify the certificate paths and ensure they are correct
- Check the validity of your certificates using `openssl`
- Review and update your AWS IoT Core policies to ensure they allow the required actions

### Device Connection Issues

**Issue**: Device not found or unable to connect

**Solution**:

- Ensure the device is properly connected and powered on
- Verify the correct port is selected

### Measurement Errors

**Issue**: Errors during measurement or incomplete data

**Solution**:

- Check the device for any hardware issues
- Verify the measurement protocol is correctly defined

### Message Publishing Issues

**Issue**: Failed to publish message or invalid message format

**Solution**:

- Verify the topic configuration is correct
- Ensure the message payload adheres to the expected format
- Validate the message using a JSON schema validation tool

## Debug Mode Usage

Enable debug mode to get more detailed output and logs.

```bash
# Start the tool in debug mode
mmi --debug
```
