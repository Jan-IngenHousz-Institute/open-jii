## Context

Managing agricultural sensor data requires a structured approach to ensure consistency, security, and reproducibility across diverse field experiments. The governance framework leverages catalogs, schemas, and tables to organize data, enforce access controls, and optimize query performance. Key objectives include:

- **Reproducibility & Auditability:** Immutable raw data and comprehensive logging ensure that data processing is repeatable and traceable.
- **Data Isolation & Access Control:** Isolating experiment data prevents interference and supports role-based permissions.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** A standardized structure facilitates adding or archiving experiments and simplifies schema management.
- **Consistency & Performance:** Uniform naming conventions and preprocessed data storage enhance data clarity and reduce query times.

## Decision

Implement a data governance framework structured around Databricks Unity Catalog’s three-tier namespace (Catalog → Schema → Table), with the following key elements:

- **Catalogs:**

  - **Decision:** Use a single catalog (e.g., `agriculture_sensors`) to encompass the entire domain of agricultural sensor data.
  - **Rationale:** Simplifies the enforcement of enterprise security policies and minimizes fragmentation while allowing scalability into additional catalog domains if needed.

- **Schemas:**

  - **Decision:** Create separate schemas within the catalog for each experiment (e.g., `exp_plant_growth_2024`, `exp_soil_moisture_august`).
  - **Rationale:** This logical separation prevents data mixing, avoids naming conflicts, and enables granular access control and streamlined data lifecycle management.

- **Tables:**

  - **Decision:** Standardize table structures within each schema, including:
    1. **Raw Data Table (`raw_data`):** Ingests and preserves original sensor readings.
    2. **Clean Data Table (`clean_data`):** Contains validated, analysis-ready data.
    3. **Metadata Tables:** Includes tables such as `experiment_metadata`, `sensor_metadata`, and `plant_metadata` for contextual information.
  - **Rationale:** Retaining raw data ensures reproducibility, while clean data tables and metadata centralize context and enhance query performance.

- **Volumes:**

  - **Decision:** Utilize volumes to store both raw and processed datasets.
  - **Rationale:** Supports high data throughput and efficient storage management, ensuring performance and cost optimization.

- **Views:**

  - **Decision:** Create views to provide virtual, analysis-ready representations of the data.
  - **Rationale:** Simplifies complex queries and reduces data duplication by offering aggregated or filtered perspectives tailored to analytical needs.

- **Data Access & Security:**
  - **Decision:** Enforce strict governance policies, including role-based access control (RBAC), data retention policies, and audit logging.
  - **Rationale:** Protects sensitive data, balances storage costs with regulatory requirements, and ensures transparency through detailed operational logs.

## Consequences

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Reproducibility & Auditability:**  
  Immutable raw data and thorough logs provide clear traceability and repeatability of data processes.
- **Robust Data Isolation & Security:**  
  Dedicated schemas and RBAC prevent data interference and limit user access to relevant data.
- **Scalable and Maintainable Architecture:**  
  A standardized structure simplifies adding new experiments and managing schema modifications over time.
- **Optimized Query Performance:**  
  Preprocessed, analysis-ready tables and views reduce query times and computational overhead.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Single Catalog vs. Multiple Catalogs:**  
  While a single catalog simplifies management and centralizes security, it may limit isolation for vastly different data domains if expansion is needed.
- **Granular Isolation vs. Administrative Overhead:**  
  Creating a schema per experiment improves clarity and access control but can increase administrative complexity and require automation for efficient management.
- **Immutable Raw Data vs. Storage Costs:**  
  Retaining raw data ensures reproducibility but may lead to increased storage costs, necessitating effective retention and archival policies.
- **Preprocessed Data vs. Data Freshness:**  
  Although clean data tables enhance query performance, the preprocessing steps might introduce slight delays between data ingestion and availability.
- **Strict RBAC vs. Management Complexity:**  
  Detailed access controls improve security but require ongoing management and periodic audits to remain effective.

## Conclusion

The proposed data governance model establishes a robust, scalable, and secure framework for managing agricultural sensor data. By leveraging a single catalog with dedicated schemas for each experiment, standardized table structures, and comprehensive security policies, the design ensures data integrity, optimized performance, and reproducibility. Despite some trade-offs in administrative overhead and storage costs, the framework aligns with industry best practices and meets the strategic needs of managing agricultural sensor data in a dynamic research environment.
