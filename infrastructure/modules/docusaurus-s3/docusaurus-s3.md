# üìñ Docusaurus S3 Module (with CloudFront Restriction)

This module provisions an **Amazon S3 bucket** for hosting a Docusaurus static website. The bucket is created as a private resource with all public access blocked. A bucket policy is attached to allow read-only access only when requests originate from a specific CloudFront distribution. This design ensures that the S3 bucket remains private and that all public access is routed through CloudFront.

## üìñ Overview

Docusaurus is a static site generator optimized for documentation and blogs. This module creates a private S3 bucket and applies a bucket policy that permits access only from a CloudFront distribution‚Äîusing the CloudFront service principal with a condition that the request's source ARN matches the provided CloudFront distribution ARN. This ensures that your site content is served securely via CloudFront.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Example configuration in your root module:

```hcl
module "docusaurus_s3" {
  source                      = "../../modules/docusaurus-s3"
  bucket_name                 = "my-docusaurus-site"
  cloudfront_distribution_arn = module.cloudfront.cloudfront_distribution_arn
}
```

## üì§ Outputs

| Name                     | Description                                                           |

## üåç Notes

- The **S3 bucket does not enable website hosting mode**, as CloudFront is used for delivery.
- Ensure that **CloudFront is properly configured** to serve content from the S3 bucket.
- **Docusaurus static files must be uploaded manually or via CI/CD pipelines**.
