## üîç Overview

OpenJII supports the entire plant research workflow, from data collection to analysis:

- **Data Collection** - Secure MQTT-based protocol for MultispeQ devices and custom IoT sensors
- **Data Processing** - Sophisticated data pipeline with medallion architecture
- **Experiment Management** - Tools for creating and managing research experiments
- **Data Analysis** - Jupyter notebooks and visualization tools for research
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for users and developers
- **Custom IoT Development** - Node-RED flows for creating and integrating your own IoT devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

OpenJII leverages modern technologies across its stack:

### Frontend

- **Next.js** - React framework for the web application
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Radix UI** via ShadCN UI - Accessible component primitives
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe code

### Backend

- **NestJS** - Progressive Node.js framework for building server-side applications
- **Drizzle ORM** - TypeScript ORM for SQL databases with a focus on developer experience
- **Zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference

### IoT Development

- **Node-RED** - Flow-based development tool for visual programming of IoT devices
- **MQTT** - Lightweight messaging protocol for IoT communications
- **Custom Nodes** - Extended Node-RED functionality for agricultural sensors

### Infrastructure

- **OpenTofu** (formerly Terraform) - Infrastructure as Code for cloud provisioning
- **AWS** - Cloud infrastructure provider (IoT Core, S3, Timestream, etc.)
- **Docker** - Containerization for development and deployment
- **Databricks** - Unified analytics platform for data processing

### Documentation

- **Docusaurus** - Documentation website generator

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The platform is built using a modern cloud-native architecture:

- **Frontend**: Next.js web application for user interface
- **Backend**: NestJS API for experiment management and authentication
- **Data Platform**: Databricks for data processing and analytics
- **IoT Infrastructure**: AWS IoT Core for device connectivity
- **Storage**: Combination of S3 for raw data and Timestream for time-series metrics
- **Authentication**: OIDC-compliant identity provider

For details on the infrastructure, see the [infrastructure documentation](infrastructure/README.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22+
- pnpm (as package manager)
- Docker (for local development)
- AWS CLI (for infrastructure deployment)
- OpenTofu CLI (for infrastructure management)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jan-IngenHousz-Institute/open-jii.git
cd open-jii

# Use the correct Node version
nvm use

# Enable PNPM
corepack enable

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run development server for all applications
pnpm dev

# Build all applications
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Start Node-RED for IoT device development
pnpm --filter node-red start
```

### IoT Development with Node-RED

The platform includes a Node-RED application that allows you to create and integrate your own IoT devices:

1. Start the Node-RED server:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter node-red start
   ```

2. Access the Node-RED editor at http://localhost:1880

3. Use the custom OpenJII nodes to:
   - Connect to the MQTT broker
   - Process sensor data
   - Create visualization dashboards
   - Integrate with the OpenJII data pipeline

For detailed tutorials on creating your own IoT devices with Node-RED, see the [IoT Development Guide](apps/docs/docs/004-iot-development).

### Infrastructure Management

```bash
# Initialize OpenTofu
cd infrastructure/env/dev
tofu init

# Plan infrastructure changes
tofu plan

# Apply infrastructure changes
tofu apply
```
